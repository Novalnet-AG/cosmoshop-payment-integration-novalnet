It contains additional database fields for payment status, customer&apos;s language, etc., and serves as the base for recognizing which articles (and download files) belong to an order. <br /><br />3)<br /> in payment methods, an additional &quot;book&quot; checkbox appears. Here you can set whether the payment method should be saved as &quot;directly booked&quot;, activating the download right away (such as with Ipayment/telecash payments)<br /><br />4)<br />in shipping methods, a dropdown has been added, containing &quot;standard shipping&quot;, &quot;download&quot;, and &quot;download mixed order&quot; (only if the download plug-in is activated) <br /><br />5)<br /> in the article form there is a &quot;purely download article&quot; selection.

      "name" : "URL optimization",
      "text" : "<div>\n<p>With URL optimization, the shop makes available a new generation of URLs, which use meaningful key values and drastically shorten the entire URL. The following three URL formats are offered to this effect:</p>\n<br />\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.domain.de/%5bArtikel-Begriff%5d.htm\">http://www.domain.de/[Artikel-Begriff].htm</a> <br />for articles</p>\n<br />\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.domain.de/%5bHauptrubrik-Begriff%5d/%5bUnterrubrik-Begriff%5d/index.htm\">http://www.domain.de/[Hauptrubrik-Begriff]/[Unterrubrik-Begriff]/index.htm</a> for categories</p>\n<br />\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.domain.de/Infos/%5bZusatzseiten-Name%5d.htm\">http://www.domain.de/Infos/[Zusatzseiten-Name].htm</a> <br />for additional pages</p>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br />\n<p>The article and main category or subcategory terms can be assigned in any way you like and will be assigned by the shop completely automatically, if possible (based on article name or the category name). The keys for the additional pages are created automatically from their names.</p>\n<br />\n<p>To make short URLs possible, only the shop&apos;s &quot;standard requests&ldquo; are displayed in short form, but as soon as specific session data is available (such as shopping cart contents), the compact version is no longer possible in order to avoid duplicate content. Recognized search engines always see the compact URLs, leaving only the article and category views indexed for search engines for the midterm.</p>\n<br />\n<p><b>Good to know:</b></p>\n<br />\n<p>URL optimization uses cookies. Only after the cookie has been set can the short version be displayed (until then you will see a version with  /nocache prefix or the old URL). There are two standard options:</p>\n<br />\n<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; older shops and deep links in shops set the cookie during the first shop visit. Because it isn&apos;t clear at first whether the browser really accepts cookies, for the following pages a compact URL with a &quot;nocache/&quot; -prefix and shopping cart ID is created. Only after such a URL is opened and the transferred shopping cart ID is matched to the cookie will the compact URL be shown.</p>\n<br />\n<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a current shop is opened via the pure domain. Because the start page is an index.shtml, a cookie can&apos;t be set during the first visit (although an attempt to do so is made). For this reason, the  &quot;nocache&quot; version of the URL is shown. If this page is opened, the cookie can be set correctly, but for the current page there is a problem, since the previously set cookie doesn&apos;t correspond with the previously saved one. For this reason, the compatibility mode is activated and the displayed links are made in the old format. Therefore: 1st click has nocache URL, 2nd click has a URL in the old format, and starting from the 3rd click you will start seeing compact URLs. This does NOT obstruct search engines.</p>\n<br />\n<p>As soon as content is available in the shopping cart, the URLs switch to the &quot;nocache&quot; version in order to avoid caching in the customer browser (because the mini shopping cart changes, the cached &quot;blank&quot; page cannot be displayed here.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Whether the customer sees a non-cached URL or, in compatibility mode (see b), an old URL, the search engines always see the compact URLs, because it is assumed that they will not log in or place anything in the shopping cart. The nocache URLs aren&apos;t as eye-catching as the customer would ideally like, but they are irrelevant from the point of view of search engines.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Important: to display the compact URLs for detail views from the list view, the browse links in the detail view must be deactivated. This is because browse links are used to navigate through the history (and the backlink to the category view, etc.) and interfere with the URL. If the URL has been optimized, this parameter would be lost and the backlinks wouldn&apos;t work. For this reason, these URLs aren&apos;t optimized, as long as these parameters exist (they will disappear if browse links are deactivated).</p>\n<br />\n<p>In the current URL optimization there is a URL key generator, which automatically tries to set the fitting URL key using article names and category names (normalized version of the name). If this generator isn&apos;t available yet, you can add it with just a few clicks. Warning: the generator creates a URL key only when it is unique. If the URL key is already taken by another article, the URL key field will remain empty (otherwise <a href=\"http://domain.de/%5bUrlkey%5d.htm\">http://domain.com/[Urlkey].htm</a> wouldn&apos;t be unique. </p>\n</div>",
